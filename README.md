for and while loops, array, array method, string methods

<b>What I learned:</b>

I presented two solutions to this exercise to help me expand my thinking and try to solve same problem using different concepts. 

Using different concepts to solve same problem allows me compare and see what ways are more efficient with regards to time complexities.
